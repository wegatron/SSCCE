* creating a configuration file
    doxygen -g <config-file>

** import params in config files

*** EXTRACT_ALL option is set to NO in the configuration file (the default), then doxygen will only generate documentation for documented entities. 
*** INPUT tag empty and doxygen will search for sources in the current directory.
*** FILE_PATTERNS tag (for instance *.cpp *.h). Only files that match one of the patterns will be parsed (if the patterns are omitted a list of typical patterns is used for the types of files doxygen supports). For recursive parsing of a source tree you must set the RECURSIVE tag to YES. 
*** HAVE_DOT enable graphviz support
*** CALL_GRAPH CALLER_GRAPH a graphical call graph is drawn for each function showing the functions that the function directly or indirectly calls
    \callgraph When this command is put in a comment block of a function or method regardless of the value of CALL_GRAPH.
    \hidecallergraph When this command is put in a comment block of a function or method and then doxygen will not generate a caller graph for that function. The caller graph will not be generated regardless of the value of CALLER_GRAPH.

2. running doxygen
    doxygen <config-file>
