* creating a configuration file
    doxygen -g <config-file>

** import params in config files

*** EXTRACT_ALL option is set to NO in the configuration file (the default), then doxygen will only generate documentation for documented entities. 
*** INPUT tag empty and doxygen will search for sources in the current directory.
*** FILE_PATTERNS tag (for instance *.cpp *.h). Only files that match one of the patterns will be parsed (if the patterns are omitted a list of typical patterns is used for the types of files doxygen supports). For recursive parsing of a source tree you must set the RECURSIVE tag to YES. 


2. running doxygen
    doxygen <config-file>
